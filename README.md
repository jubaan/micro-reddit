# Building with Active Record

> Collaborative project. We put our knowledge of active record, models, and asossiations to the test.

We created a "micro-reddit" app where users can create a post and add comments to it.

We practice building models and relational databases, doing migrations and making rules for validating the data input.

Models implemented:

- Author: name, email, password, has_many: posts, has_many: comments
- Post: title, body, belongs_to: Author, has_many: Comments
- Comments: body, belongs_to: Author, belongs_to: Post
